# UAPM – Unified AI Project Manifest

UAPM is a structured, machine-readable document that acts as a contract between a software project and its AI collaborators. It defines the rules, context, and expectations needed for AI systems to contribute consistently, predictably, and effectively.

## Why UAPM?

As AI becomes increasingly integrated into software development, teams need a clear and standardized way to communicate project intent to AI systems. UAPM solves this by offering:

- ✅ Consistency: All AI agents follow the same rules
- 📖 Clarity: Design and logic are measurable and unambiguous
- 🔍 Source of truth: AI reads the latest and most accurate information
- 🧩 Versionable & shareable: Changes are tracked like any config file
- 🛡️ Fewer bugs: Built-in constraints reduce errors
- 🚀 Faster onboarding: Humans and AIs understand the project quickly

## Structure Overview

UAPM includes sections like:

- Metadata  
- Components & responsibilities  
- Design specifications  
- Workflow & rules  
- Data model
